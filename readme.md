## General-Piracy
- [Awesome Piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) A huge curated list of piracy resources. Some of the links are outdated, but the source is incredibly invaluable none-the-less.
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) Home of the wayback-machine. Basically the library of the internet as far as media is concerned. So much is on here it's rediculous. If you're in a collection, be sure to view all files on the right panel if you're looking for a specific file. Some may require you to sign in.
- [The Proxy Bay](https://proxybay.github.io/) List of mirror sites pulling from The Pirate Bay's database. Visiting the pirate bay directly is sketchy these days, but it's database will always be invaluable. Do note however that in more recent times, their collection has become more and more unmoderated over time, so tred with caution.


## Videogames

### Videogame-Piracy
- [Magnet Games](https://magnet-games.com/index.php) Cute website that has torrents for complete game sets to most retro consoles. Click a console in the header, go to anything/collections, and you'll want to torrent no-intro if it's available for that console. Curate the list in your torrent manager from there.
- [Old Games Finder](http://www.oldgamesfinder.com/) Search engine to find copies of old PC games. Some sites it may lead you to are paid, but not all.
- [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/?p=vault) Okay piracy site for downloading individual retro games, however limits the numbers of downloads you can have running at once, and can be quite slow.
- [NXBrew](https://nxbrew.com/) Site hosting Nintendo Switch NSPs (games).
- [Fitgirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) Repacks for more modern games. (Repacks are compressed versions of games, meaning they're inherently not going to be fully accurate, but I've rarely had problems). As for other repackers, fitgirl endources RG Mechanics, RG Revenants, RG Catalyst, Xatab, El Amigos, Kapital Sin, KaosKrew (rips). However I've never had to use them.
- [Free GOG Games](https://freegogpcgames.com/) Free release for every game on GOG, since they're all DRM free.
- [r/CrackWatch](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/) Gaming piracy subreddit. Will tell you who cracked a game and removed it's DRM if a game has been cracked, which should give you enough information on where to find said cracked game. Also carries with it other useful info. Be sure to read the beginners guide on the sidebar.


### Videogame-Emulation
- [Emulation Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/) A wiki on videogame emulation. Extremely useful if you want to compare and contrast features of emulators for a given console. Especially good for figuring out what the best given emulator for a console is.
- [Retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com/)  The primary frontend for libretro. Nice if you want to have all your retro games in one place, navigatable with a controller, and especially useful if you're looking to use it's unique features (netplay, shaders, etc). Download emulators as cores from within the program, scan for your games, and then run the game with their respective core. Easier than it sounds. I prefer it to standalone counterparts for most emulators, but not all. Also sick for emulating on console, I have retroarch installed on my Switch, for example. Switch Online SNES and NES library be damned.
- Emulator Compatability Lists. Basically, for any given emulator, they'll list all games for the console they're emulating, and how well they're emulated. In the case of the [Dolphin Wiki](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) they'll even list optimal emulator settings, enhancements, and more for individual games.

### Videogame-Other
- [Hacking & Homebrew](https://rentry.co/Guides) From the homebrew threads on 4chan's /vg/ board. Follow any guide here for it's respective console and you wont have any trouble if you have basic reading comprehension. The anons in the thread are generally pretty helpful if you actually did your reading and couldn't find an answer.
- [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) Database of cover assets for Steam, since a lot of games are missing covers and the like. Includes non-steam games as well, in case you put those in your steam library.

## Cool Stuff
- [Earthbound Battle Backgrounds](https://github.kdex.de/earthbound-battle-backgrounds) Generator for moving earthbound backgrounds. up/down/left/right arrows for controlls.
- [Sierra Text Generator](http://deathgenerator.com/) Also known as Death Generator. Lets you create custom text boxes in the style of a ton of different games.
- [PetPet](https://benisland.neocities.org/petpet/) Tool for creating those petting gifs memes. 
- [KidPix](https://kidpix.app/) A port of KidPix to browser
