## General-Piracy
- [Awesome Piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) A huge curated list of piracy resources. Some of the links are outdated, but the source is incredibly invaluable none-the-less. [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme) lists in general are very useful.
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) Home of the wayback-machine. Basically the library of the internet as far as media is concerned. So much is on here it's rediculous. If you're in a collection, be sure to view all files on the right panel if you're looking for a specific file. Some may require you to sign in.
- [The Proxy Bay](https://proxybay.github.io/) List of mirror sites pulling from The Pirate Bay's database. Visiting the pirate bay directly is sketchy these days, but it's database will always be invaluable. Do note however that in more recent times, their collection has become more and more unmoderated over time, so tred with caution.
- [Rarbg](https://rarbg.to/) Movie torrenting site. Use [Rarbg Proxy](https://rarbg-proxy.github.io/) if it's blocked in your country.
- [Piracy.moe](https://piracy.moe/) Previously known as the anime index, a spreadsheet for anime, manga, and other weeb piracy warez
- [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/) Anime torrenting database. Probably the best out there. My first line of fire for anime piracy. [sukebei.nyaa.si](sukebei.nyaa.si) is their NSFW counterpart.
- [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/) Peer-to-Peer network for (mostly) music piracy. A lot like how Limewire worked. If you're on Linux use [Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/) to access soulseek.

## Videogames

### Videogame-Piracy
- [Magnet Games](https://magnet-games.com/index.php) Cute website that has torrents for complete game sets to most retro consoles. Click a console in the header, go to anything/collections, and you'll want to torrent no-intro if it's available for that console. Curate the list in your torrent manager from there.
- [Old Games Finder](http://www.oldgamesfinder.com/) Search engine to find copies of old PC games. Some sites it may lead you to are paid, but not all.
- [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/?p=vault) Okay piracy site for downloading individual retro games, however limits the numbers of downloads you can have running at once, and can be quite slow.
- [EmuParadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/Complete_ROM_Sets_(Full_Sets_in_One_File)_ROMs/List-All-Titles/37) Famous rom site that was sued by nintendo a few years back. Hasn't been the same since, but is still useful. Some games have been delisted by the site's search engine, so use 3rd party search engines to search games on their database.
    -[EmuParadise Workaround Script](https://gist.github.com/infval/c69b479ff0bd590f2dd7e1975fe2fcad) Is a [userscript](#userscripts) to allow downloading of games from EmuParadise again. Since nintendo sued them years ago. Most if not all the roms are still on their servers, they just removed the download links. On a game page use "download with workaround script".
- [NXBrew](https://nxbrew.com/) Site hosting Nintendo Switch NSPs (games).
- [r/CrackWatch](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/) Gaming piracy subreddit. Will tell you who cracked a game and removed it's DRM if a game has been cracked, which should give you enough information on where to find said cracked game. Also carries with it other useful info. Be sure to read the beginners guide on the sidebar.
- [Pirated Games Mega Thread](https://rentry.co/pgames-mega-thread) Lists resources curated by those at r/CrackWatch, as well as some anti-recommendations so you know what to watch out for. Anything on my list superseeds anything here (at least for me) obviously.  
- [Fitgirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) Repacks for more modern games. (Repacks are compressed versions of games, meaning they're inherently not going to be fully accurate, but I've rarely had problems). As for other repackers, fitgirl endources RG Mechanics, RG Revenants, RG Catalyst, Xatab, El Amigos, Kapital Sin, and KaosKrew (rips). However I've never had to use them.

### Videogame-Emulation
- [Emulation Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/) A wiki on videogame emulation. Extremely useful if you want to compare and contrast features of emulators for a given console. Especially good for figuring out what the best given emulator for a console is.

### Videogame-Other
- [Hacking & Homebrew](https://rentry.co/Guides) From the homebrew threads on 4chan's /vg/ board. Follow any guide here for it's respective console and you wont have any trouble if you have basic reading comprehension. Also provides links to piracy websites in the post-instillation sections.
    - [webcfw](https://webcfw.sdsetup.com/) Nintendo Switch Payload Loader that works in chromium browsers. For booting into switch hacks. 
- [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) Database of cover assets for Steam, since a lot of games are missing covers and the like. Includes non-steam games as well, in case you put those in your steam library.


## Privacy
- [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) The only password manager worth a damn. Open-source, audited, and regulary updated.
- [Privacy Guides](https://privacyguides.org/) Basically the authority in protecting your privacy and making your digital life more secure, in my opinion.
- [FOSS Front-Ends](https://gitlab.com/FSMdotCOM/foss-front-ends-and-alternatives) Free Open Source Software alternatives to and tools to various popular services, such as many social media platforms.
- [Insular](https://gitlab.com/secure-system/Insular) A FOSS app that sandboxes apps you select into a seperate profile which can be turned on and off. Good for keeping apps which you dont trust to send as little data about you as possible, as well as make sure they're all turned off entirely when insular's profile is turned off. It is available on F-Droid.

### VPNs

## Addons

### Browser-Extensions
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) Adblocker, malware blocker, and tracker blocker. Blocks the visible AND invisible shittyness that comes with ads and other bullshit like them. A must install.
- [Image Search Options](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-search-options/) Reverse image searcher, super useful since google doesn't always give you the image you're looking for.
- [Sponsorblock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) Skip youtube sponsors. Works better than you'd think it would. Also offers options to skip recaps, non-music sections of music videos, self-promo, and more.
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) An extension that lets you load userscripts. Think of them like modifications to websites, without being their own full extension. If an extension has a userscript version, jump for it. Your ram will thank you. You can find userscripts I use below.
- [Save Tabbed Images](https://github.com/kevinsqi/save_tabbed_images) Good for if you want to just open a new window, open a ton of images in new tabs, and download them all. Constantly removed from the chrome webstore for some reason, and loves to uninstall it's self from chrome. I dont think google likes this one, but there's ways to get it to run none-the-less.

### Userscripts
- [Tampermonkey scripts list](https://www.tampermonkey.net/scripts.php) Page listing resources for finding new userscripts.
- [Userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/) Website for sharing cosmetic website modifications. Install them as userscripts, dont use stylish. Included because it isn't in Tampermonkey's script list for some reason.
- [4chan X](https://www.4chan-x.net/) Chan boards it supports are basically unusable without it. Thread watcher, view full image on hover, board hotbar, catalogue default, keybinds. It's OP.
- [Anti Adblock Killer](https://reek.github.io/anti-adblock-killer/) You know those pop-ups you get sometimes when using an adblocker? This helps to get rid of those. Install and forget.
- [AAK Cont for uBlock Origin](https://xuhaiyang1234.gitlab.io/AAK-Cont/dist/aak-cont-script-ubo.user.js) Anti-Adblock Killer Continued for uBlock Origin. Should be self-explanitory.


## Programs
- [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) Torrenting client. The only one worth a damn.
- [JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org/) Download manager. Scrape websites, read the clipboard for links to downloads, etc. Have them all in a neat list. Especially useful for archive.org collections or for when you have a slow internet connection.
- [Handbreak](https://handbrake.fr/) Video transcoder. Compress, convert, etc. Throw videos in and choose which format you want and watch the filesize shrink.
- [Open Broadcast Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/) Best video recording and streaming software there is. Pretty self-explanitory.
- [List of Adobe Alternatives](https://twitter.com/XdanielArt/status/1434611199140896772) Sick list of alternatives to adobe suite software. Useful for linux or if you just hate adobe (But, of course, pirating their software will always be moral :P )
- [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) Command line program for downloading vids from youtube and [others](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html), including mp3s and thumbnails. No more "youtube download mp3" searching for you. Albeit, if you insist on using a website, [AllTube](https://alltubedownload.net/) is a website that uses youtube-dl for it's backend. If you dont want to use command line, you can also get [youtube-dl GUI](https://github.com/jely2002/youtube-dl-gui).

## Cool Stuff
- [15.ai](https://15.ai/) Accurate text to speech generator which mimicks characters from multiple franchises. Has a history of going down for a long time to be worked on, released for a short period, and so on. So make what you need while you have the chance.
- [NoClip](https://noclip.website/) Lets you look around 3D environments in browser for a ton of games you absolutely played growing up as if you were using noclip in source.
- [Nostalgic Kids' Sites](http://nostalgiakidssites.com/) An archival project managed by [Rare Noggin Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/c/RareNogginStuff) that's dedicated to hosting 00's and 10's websites aimed at pre-school children. Hosts snapshots of Nick Jr., Nick Jr. Playtime, PBS Kids, and PBS Sprout at the time of writing.


## Other
- [Catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/) A nice, free, minimum bullshit image and file cloud. Also check out [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/) for hosting files which are temporary in nature and can just be deleted whenever.

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) Used to be valuable for finding information about niche topics. If you still insist on using this echo-chamber site as a keyword, make sure the results are pre-2020.
