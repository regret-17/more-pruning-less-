## General-Piracy
- [Awesome Piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) A huge curated list of piracy resources. Some of the links are outdated, but the source is incredibly invaluable none-the-less. [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme) lists in general are very useful.
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) Home of the wayback-machine. Basically the library of the internet as far as media is concerned. So much is on here it's rediculous. If you're in a collection, be sure to view all files on the right panel if you're looking for a specific file. Some may require you to sign in.
- [The Proxy Bay](https://proxybay.github.io/) List of mirror sites pulling from The Pirate Bay's database. Visiting the pirate bay directly is sketchy these days, but it's database will always be invaluable. Do note however that in more recent times, their collection has become more and more unmoderated over time, so tred with caution.
- [Rarbg](https://rarbg.to/) Movie torrenting site. Use [Rarbg Proxy](https://rarbg-proxy.github.io/) if it's blocked in your country.
- [Piracy.moe](https://piracy.moe/) Previously known as the anime index, a spreadsheet for anime, manga, and other weeb piracy warez
- [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/) Anime torrenting database. Probably the best out there. My first line of fire for anime piracy. [sukebei.nyaa.si](sukebei.nyaa.si) is their NSFW counterpart.
- [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/) Peer-to-Peer network for (mostly) music piracy. A lot like how Limewire worked. If you're on Linux use [Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/) to access soulseek.

## Videogames

### Videogame-Piracy
- [Magnet Games](https://magnet-games.com/index.php) Cute website that has torrents for complete game sets to most retro consoles. Click a console in the header, go to anything/collections, and you'll want to torrent no-intro if it's available for that console. Curate the list in your torrent manager from there.
- [Old Games Finder](http://www.oldgamesfinder.com/) Search engine to find copies of old PC games. Some sites it may lead you to are paid, but not all.
- [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/?p=vault) Okay piracy site for downloading individual retro games, however limits the numbers of downloads you can have running at once, and can be quite slow.
- [EmuParadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/Complete_ROM_Sets_(Full_Sets_in_One_File)_ROMs/List-All-Titles/37) Famous rom site that was sued by nintendo a few years back. Hasn't been the same since, but is still useful. Some games have been delisted by the site's search engine, so use 3rd party search engines to search games on their database.
    -[EmuParadise Workaround Script](https://gist.github.com/infval/c69b479ff0bd590f2dd7e1975fe2fcad) Is a [userscript](#userscripts) to allow downloading of games from EmuParadise again. Since nintendo sued them years ago. Most if not all the roms are still on their servers, they just removed the download links. On a game page use "download with workaround script".
- [NXBrew](https://nxbrew.com/) Site hosting Nintendo Switch NSPs (games).
- [r/CrackWatch](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/) Gaming piracy subreddit. Will tell you who cracked a game and removed it's DRM if a game has been cracked, which should give you enough information on where to find said cracked game. Also carries with it other useful info. Be sure to read the beginners guide on the sidebar.
- [Pirated Games Mega Thread](https://rentry.co/pgames-mega-thread) Lists resources curated by those at r/CrackWatch, as well as some anti-recommendations so you know what to watch out for. Anything on my list superseeds anything here (at least for me) obviously.  
- [Fitgirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) Repacks for more modern games. (Repacks are compressed versions of games, meaning they're inherently not going to be fully accurate, but I've rarely had problems). As for other repackers, fitgirl endources RG Mechanics, RG Revenants, RG Catalyst, Xatab, El Amigos, Kapital Sin, and KaosKrew (rips). However I've never had to use them.

### Videogame-Emulation
- [Emulation Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/) A wiki on videogame emulation. Extremely useful if you want to compare and contrast features of emulators for a given console. Especially good for figuring out what the best given emulator for a console is.

### Videogame-Other
- [Hacking & Homebrew](https://rentry.co/Guides) From the homebrew threads on 4chan's /vg/ board. Follow any guide here for it's respective console and you wont have any trouble if you have basic reading comprehension. Also provides links to piracy websites in the post-instillation sections.
    - [webcfw](https://webcfw.sdsetup.com/) Nintendo Switch Payload Loader that works in chromium browsers. For booting into switch hacks.

- [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) A private operating system for google pixel (and some other select) devices. Comes with MicroG, which lets you use google services without having to give google any data. Also includes strong sandboxing features to keep apps from connecting to the internet or uploading data from other apps.
- [F-Droid/NeoStore](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store) A client for F-Droid. F-Droid is a Play Store alternative which only hosts manually approved apps which meet very strict privacy and security criteria. 
- [ArouraStore](auroraoss.com) A FOSS alternative to the Play Store. Lets you download apps from the playstore without signing in to Google, and without giving Google any real data about you. Also includes a section under every app showing how many trackers it has if they've been reported to the database. It is available on F-Droid.
- [Insular](https://gitlab.com/secure-system/Insular) A FOSS app that sandboxes apps you select into a seperate profile which can be turned on and off. Good for keeping apps which you dont trust to send as little data about you as possible, as well as make sure they're all turned off entirely when insular's profile is turned off. It is available on F-Droid.

- [DarkReader](https://darkreader.org/) A quick way to make websites dark which dont have a dark theme. Though i'd still recommend native dark themes for websites if they support the feature, as sometimes dark reader can hide elements which are supposed to be visible. Able to be toggled on a per-website basis, and toggleable with a hotkey.
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) An extension that lets you load userscripts. Think of them like modifications to websites, without being their own full extension. If an extension has a userscript version, jump for it. Your ram will thank you. You can find userscripts I use below.

If you dont want to use command line, you can also get [youtube-dl GUI](https://github.com/jely2002/youtube-dl-gui).

## Cool Stuff

## General-Piracy
- [Awesome Piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) A huge curated list of piracy resources. Some of the links are outdated, but the source is incredibly invaluable none-the-less. [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme) lists in general are very useful.
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) Home of the wayback-machine. Basically the library of the internet as far as media is concerned. So much is on here it's rediculous. If you're in a collection, be sure to view all files on the right panel if you're looking for a specific file. Some may require you to sign in.
- [The Proxy Bay](https://proxybay.github.io/) List of mirror sites pulling from The Pirate Bay's database. Visiting the pirate bay directly is sketchy these days, but it's database will always be invaluable. Do note however that in more recent times, their collection has become more and more unmoderated over time, so tred with caution.
- [Rarbg](https://rarbg.to/) Movie torrenting site. Use [Rarbg Proxy](https://rarbg-proxy.github.io/) if it's blocked in your country.
- [Piracy.moe](https://piracy.moe/) Previously known as the anime index, a spreadsheet for anime, manga, and other weeb piracy warez
- [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/) Anime torrenting database. Probably the best out there. My first line of fire for anime piracy. [sukebei.nyaa.si](sukebei.nyaa.si) is their NSFW counterpart.
- [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/) Peer-to-Peer network for (mostly) music piracy. A lot like how Limewire worked. If you're on Linux use [Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/) to access soulseek.

## Videogames

### Videogame-Piracy
- [Magnet Games](https://magnet-games.com/index.php) Cute website that has torrents for complete game sets to most retro consoles. Click a console in the header, go to anything/collections, and you'll want to torrent no-intro if it's available for that console. Curate the list in your torrent manager from there.
- [Old Games Finder](http://www.oldgamesfinder.com/) Search engine to find copies of old PC games. Some sites it may lead you to are paid, but not all.
- [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/?p=vault) Okay piracy site for downloading individual retro games, however limits the numbers of downloads you can have running at once, and can be quite slow.
- [EmuParadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/Complete_ROM_Sets_(Full_Sets_in_One_File)_ROMs/List-All-Titles/37) Famous rom site that was sued by nintendo a few years back. Hasn't been the same since, but is still useful. Some games have been delisted by the site's search engine, so use 3rd party search engines to search games on their database.
    -[EmuParadise Workaround Script](https://gist.github.com/infval/c69b479ff0bd590f2dd7e1975fe2fcad) Is a [userscript](#userscripts) to allow downloading of games from EmuParadise again. Since nintendo sued them years ago. Most if not all the roms are still on their servers, they just removed the download links. On a game page use "download with workaround script".
- [NXBrew](https://nxbrew.com/) Site hosting Nintendo Switch NSPs (games).
- [r/CrackWatch](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/) Gaming piracy subreddit. Will tell you who cracked a game and removed it's DRM if a game has been cracked, which should give you enough information on where to find said cracked game. Also carries with it other useful info. Be sure to read the beginners guide on the sidebar.
- [Pirated Games Mega Thread](https://rentry.co/pgames-mega-thread) Lists resources curated by those at r/CrackWatch, as well as some anti-recommendations so you know what to watch out for. Anything on my list superseeds anything here (at least for me) obviously.  
- [Fitgirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) Repacks for more modern games. (Repacks are compressed versions of games, meaning they're inherently not going to be fully accurate, but I've rarely had problems). As for other repackers, fitgirl endources RG Mechanics, RG Revenants, RG Catalyst, Xatab, El Amigos, Kapital Sin, and KaosKrew (rips). However I've never had to use them.

### Videogame-Emulation
- [Emulation Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/) A wiki on videogame emulation. Extremely useful if you want to compare and contrast features of emulators for a given console. Especially good for figuring out what the best given emulator for a console is.

### Videogame-Other
- [Hacking & Homebrew](https://rentry.co/Guides) From the homebrew threads on 4chan's /vg/ board. Follow any guide here for it's respective console and you wont have any trouble if you have basic reading comprehension. Also provides links to piracy websites in the post-instillation sections.
    - [webcfw](https://webcfw.sdsetup.com/) Nintendo Switch Payload Loader that works in chromium browsers. For booting into switch hacks.

- [Privacy Guides](https://privacyguides.org/) Basically the authority in protecting your privacy and making your digital life more secure, in my opinion.
- [FOSS Front-Ends](https://gitlab.com/FSMdotCOM/foss-front-ends-and-alternatives) Free Open Source Software alternatives to and tools to various popular services, such as many social media platforms.
- [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) A private operating system for google pixel (and some other select) devices. Comes with MicroG, which lets you use google services without having to give google any data. Also includes strong sandboxing features to keep apps from connecting to the internet or uploading data from other apps.
- [F-Droid/NeoStore](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store) A client for F-Droid. F-Droid is a Play Store alternative which only hosts manually approved apps which meet very strict privacy and security criteria. 
- [ArouraStore](auroraoss.com) A FOSS alternative to the Play Store. Lets you download apps from the playstore without signing in to Google, and without giving Google any real data about you. Also includes a section under every app showing how many trackers it has if they've been reported to the database. It is available on F-Droid.
- [Insular](https://gitlab.com/secure-system/Insular) A FOSS app that sandboxes apps you select into a seperate profile which can be turned on and off. Good for keeping apps which you dont trust to send as little data about you as possible, as well as make sure they're all turned off entirely when insular's profile is turned off. It is available on F-Droid.

## Addons

### Browser-Extensions
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) Adblocker, malware blocker, and tracker blocker. Blocks the visible AND invisible shittyness that comes with ads and other bullshit like them. A must install.
- [Image Search Options](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-search-options/) Reverse image searcher, super useful since google doesn't always give you the image you're looking for.
- [Sponsorblock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) Skip youtube sponsors. Works better than you'd think it would. Also offers options to skip recaps, non-music sections of music videos, self-promo, and more.
- [DarkReader](https://darkreader.org/) A quick way to make websites dark which dont have a dark theme. Though i'd still recommend native dark themes for websites if they support the feature, as sometimes dark reader can hide elements which are supposed to be visible. Able to be toggled on a per-website basis, and toggleable with a hotkey.
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) An extension that lets you load userscripts. Think of them like modifications to websites, without being their own full extension. If an extension has a userscript version, jump for it. Your ram will thank you. You can find userscripts I use below.
- [Save Tabbed Images](https://github.com/kevinsqi/save_tabbed_images) Good for if you want to just open a new window, open a ton of images in new tabs, and download them all. Constantly removed from the chrome webstore for some reason, and loves to uninstall it's self from chrome. I dont think google likes this one, but there's ways to get it to run none-the-less.

### Userscripts
- [Tampermonkey scripts list](https://www.tampermonkey.net/scripts.php) Page listing resources for finding new userscripts.
- [Userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/) Website for sharing cosmetic website modifications. Install them as userscripts, dont use stylish. Included because it isn't in Tampermonkey's script list for some reason.

- [Anti Adblock Killer](https://reek.github.io/anti-adblock-killer/) You know those pop-ups you get sometimes when using an adblocker? This helps to get rid of those. Install and forget.
- [AAK Cont for uBlock Origin](https://xuhaiyang1234.gitlab.io/AAK-Cont/dist/aak-cont-script-ubo.user.js) Anti-Adblock Killer Continued for uBlock Origin. Should be self-explanitory.
- [Chrome Dark Scrollbar and Audio Player](https://userstyles.org/styles/108298) I was having trouble getting chrome themes to have a dark scrollbar, so here's a userscript for getting a dark scrollbar on chrome.
- [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/) More emotes, features, etc for twitch. Select "other" browser even if your browser is supported for the userscript.

- [List of Adobe Alternatives](https://twitter.com/XdanielArt/status/1434611199140896772) Sick list of alternatives to adobe suite software. Useful for linux or if you just hate adobe (But, of course, pirating their software will always be moral :P )

## Cool Stuff
