## General-Piracy
- [Awesome Piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) A huge curated list of piracy resources. Some of the links are outdated, but the source is incredibly invaluable none-the-less.
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) Home of the wayback-machine. Basically the library of the internet as far as media is concerned. So much is on here it's rediculous. If you're in a collection, be sure to view all files on the right panel if you're looking for a specific file. Some may require you to sign in.
- [The Proxy Bay](https://proxybay.github.io/) List of mirror sites pulling from The Pirate Bay's database. Visiting the pirate bay directly is sketchy these days, but it's database will always be invaluable. Do note however that in more recent times, their collection has become more and more unmoderated over time, so tred with caution.
- [YayPonies](https://yayponies.no/) basically all official digital media for the My Little Pony franchise. Show, Movie, Comic Books, Bonus features, etc. They also link to sister sites hosting Star Vs The Forces of Evil and Wander Over Yonder content (and deprecated Ducktales and Steven Universe content).  


## Videogames

### Videogame-Piracy
- [Magnet Games](https://magnet-games.com/index.php) Cute website that has torrents for complete game sets to most retro consoles. Click a console in the header, go to anything/collections, and you'll want to torrent no-intro if it's available for that console. Curate the list in your torrent manager from there.
- [Old Games Finder](http://www.oldgamesfinder.com/) Search engine to find copies of old PC games. Some sites it may lead you to are paid, but not all.
- [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/?p=vault) Okay piracy site for downloading individual retro games, however limits the numbers of downloads you can have running at once, and can be quite slow.
- [EmuParadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/Complete_ROM_Sets_(Full_Sets_in_One_File)_ROMs/List-All-Titles/37) Famous rom site that was sued by nintendo a few years back. Hasn't been the same sense, but is still useful. Some games have been delisted by the site's search engine, so use 3rd party search engines to search games on their database.
    -[EmuParadise Workaround Script](https://gist.github.com/infval/c69b479ff0bd590f2dd7e1975fe2fcad) Is a [userscript](#userscripts) to allow downloading of games from EmuParadise again. Since nintendo sued them years ago. Most if not all the roms are still on their servers, they just removed the download links. On a game page use "download with workaround script".
- [Archive.org Gamecube Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/GamecubeCollectionByGhostware) Full North American ISO set of gamecube games. Be sure to log in and either show all files and pick which you want, or get the torrent and manage from there in your torrent manager.
- [Archive.org Wii Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostware), [Part 2](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostwarePart2), [Part 3](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostwarePart3) 3 part collection of commercial Wii games.
- [Archive.org WiiWare Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/WiiWareCollectionByGhostware) Full .wad set for WiiWare downloadable games from the Wii Shop Channel, virtual console included.
- [NXBrew](https://nxbrew.com/) Site hosting Nintendo Switch NSPs (games).
- [r/CrackWatch](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/) Gaming piracy subreddit. Will tell you who cracked a game and removed it's DRM if a game has been cracked, which should give you enough information on where to find said cracked game. Also carries with it other useful info. Be sure to read the beginners guide on the sidebar.
- [Fitgirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) Repacks for more modern games. (Repacks are compressed versions of games, meaning they're inherently not going to be fully accurate, but I've rarely had problems). As for other repackers, fitgirl endources RG Mechanics, RG Revenants, RG Catalyst, Xatab, El Amigos, Kapital Sin, KaosKrew (rips). However I've never had to use them.
- [Free GOG Games](https://freegogpcgames.com/) Free release for every game on GOG, since they're all DRM free.


### Videogame-Emulation
- [Emulation Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/) A wiki on videogame emulation. Extremely useful if you want to compare and contrast features of emulators for a given console. Especially good for figuring out what the best given emulator for a console is.
- [Retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com/)  The frontend for libretro. Nice if you want to have all your retro games in one place, navigatable with a controller, and especially useful if you're looking to use it's unique features (netplay, shaders, etc). Download emulators as cores from within the program, scan for your games, and then run the game with their respective core. Easier than it sounds. I prefer it to standalone counterparts for most emulators, but not all. Also sick for emulating on console, I have retroarch installed on my Switch, for example. Switch Online SNES and NES library be damned. 
     - I would like to note however, that if you do not need to use retroarch, I would avoid it. There's been a lot of claims of abusive behavior from one of the lead developers, TwinAphex. Including potentially contributing to Near's suicide, and driving devs to quit projects and leave the emu scene (ex duckstation's lead developer). I'm having trouble finding much definitive information on much, but I'd be remiss not to mention it. Hopefully the scene creates a competetive alternative some day. If you're on mac, I'd recommend [OpenEmu](https://openemu.org/) above retroarch in most cases anyhow.
- Emulator Compatability Lists. Basically, for any given emulator, they'll list all games for the console they're emulating, and how well they're emulated. In the case of the [Dolphin Wiki](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) they'll even list optimal emulator settings, enhancements, and more for individual games.

### Videogame-Other
- [Hacking & Homebrew](https://rentry.co/Guides) From the homebrew threads on 4chan's /vg/ board. Follow any guide here for it's respective console and you wont have any trouble if you have basic reading comprehension. The anons in the thread are generally pretty helpful if you actually did your reading and couldn't find an answer. Also provides links to piracy websites in the post-instillation sections.
- [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) Database of cover assets for Steam, since a lot of games are missing covers and the like. Includes non-steam games as well, in case you put those in your steam library.

## Addons

### Browser-Extensions
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) Adblocker, malware blocker, and tracker blocker. Blocks the visible AND invisible shittyness that comes with ads and other bullshit like them. A must install.
- [Image Search Options](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-search-options/) Reverse image searcher, super useful since google doesn't always give you the image you're looking for.
- [Sponsorblock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) Skip youtube sponsors. Works better than you'd think it would. Also offers options to skip recaps, non-music sections of music videos, self-promo, and more.
- [DarkReader](https://darkreader.org/) A quick way to make websites dark which dont have a dark theme. Though i'd still recommend native dark themes for websites if they support the feature, as sometimes dark reader can hide elements which are supposed to be visible. Able to be toggled on a per-website basis, and toggleable with a hotkey.
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) An extension that lets you load userscripts. Think of them like modifications to websites, without being their own full extension. If an extension has a userscript version, jump for it. Your ram will thank you. You can find userscripts I use below.
- [Save Tabbed Images](https://github.com/kevinsqi/save_tabbed_images) Good for if you want to just open a new window, open a ton of images in new tabs, and download them all. Constantly removed from the chrome webstore for some reason, and loves to uninstall it's self from chrome. I dont think google likes this one, but there's ways to get it to run none-the-less.

### Userscripts
- [Tampermonkey scripts list](https://www.tampermonkey.net/scripts.php) Page listing resources for finding new userscripts.
- [Userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/) Website for sharing cosmetic website modifications. Install them as userscripts, dont use stylish. Included because it isn't in Tampermonkey's script list for some reason.
- [4chan X](https://www.4chan-x.net/) Chan boards it supports are basically unusable without it. Thread watcher, view full image on hover, board hotbar, catalogue default, keybinds. It's OP.
- [Anti Adblock Killer](https://reek.github.io/anti-adblock-killer/) You know those pop-ups you get sometimes when using an adblocker? This helps to get rid of those. Install and forget.
- [AAK Cont for uBlock Origin](https://xuhaiyang1234.gitlab.io/AAK-Cont/dist/aak-cont-script-ubo.user.js) Anti-Adblock Killer Continued for uBlock Origin. Should be self-explanitory.
- [Chrome Dark Scrollbar and Audio Player](https://userstyles.org/styles/108298) I was having trouble getting chrome themes to have a dark scrollbar, so here's a userscript for getting a dark scrollbar on chrome.
- [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/) More emotes, features, etc for twitch. Select "other" browser even if your browser is supported for the userscript.

- [BDFDB](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Library/) Required Library for a lot of plugins made by DevilBro, who's heavily involved and very prolific in the scene. A lot of plugins are dependant on it.

## Cool Stuff
